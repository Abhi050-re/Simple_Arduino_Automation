# Simple_Arduino_Automation
This repository contains an Arduino project designed to control a fan and a relay based on sensor inputs. The project integrates an LCD for user feedback and displays current system statuses.
COMPONENTS:
Arduino UNO: The main microcontroller board.
LCD Display (LM016L): For displaying real-time information.
Relays (RL1, RL2): To control external devices (e.g., a fan).
Fan: The primary device being controlled in this project.
Wiring components: To establish connections between components.
